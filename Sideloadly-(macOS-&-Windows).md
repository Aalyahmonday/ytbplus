> - macOS Catalina and up: Finder > Select your iDevice under 'Locations' > General > Enable "Show this iDevice when on Wi-Fi" option > Sync & Done.
> 
> - macOS Mojave and below: Open iTunes > Connected Device > Summary > Options > Enable "Sync with this iDevice over Wi-Fi" option > Sync & Done.
- Select your phone in the iDevice windows.
- Enter your Apple ID in the Apple account field. Password will be asked later.
- Drag & drop uYouPlus IPA to the IPA windows.
- Click **Start** and enter the password. The process might take several minutes. Just let Sideloadly does its job.

# Refresh uYouPlus
- Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days, and uYouPlus is not an exception. After 7 days, uYouPlus will no longer open (you'll see an error that says **YouTube is no longer available**).
- In order to refresh uYouPlus, you must connect your phone to your Mac/PC (via USB or Wi-fi) and reinstall uYouPlus (repeat the installation process). 
- **DO NOT** delete the current app or you will lose all app's data.
