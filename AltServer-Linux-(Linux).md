Basically, [AltServer-Linux](https://github.com/NyaMisty/AltServer-Linux) is AltStore but works on Linux. As far as I know, this is the only sideload tool that supports Linux OS. AltServer-Linux is open source and you can see it here: https://github.com/NyaMisty/AltServer-Linux

Because Linux is not my main OS, I'm afraid I can't help you much. However, if Linux is your main OS, I'm sure you know how to configurate it properly.
