_The installation process is pretty straightforward. First, set up AltServer on your PC/Mac, use AltServer to install AltStore to your devices, then use AltStore to install uYouPlus. Your iDevice must be connected to your PC/mac during the whole process._

## üêß Linux
### AltServer-Linux
- AltServer doesn't support Linux by default. Thanks [@NyaMisty](https://twitter.com/MiscMisty) to port AltServer to Linux OS. AltServer-Linux is open source and you can see its source code here: https://github.com/NyaMisty/AltServer-Linux
- Since Linux is not my main OS, I'm afraid I can't help you much. However, if Linux is your main OS, I'm sure you know how to configure it properly.
- Note that you may need to compile from the source to build the latest version of AltServer-Linux.

### AltServer-LinuxGUI
- If you prefer GUI mode rather than CLI mode, [@powenn](https://twitter.com/powen00hsiao) made a GUI version of AltServer-Linux: https://github.com/powenn/AltServer-LinuxGUI

### ZSign
- ZSign is a cross platform signing tool that can run on macOS, Windows, and Linux. However, it‚Äôs not a user-friendly tool since it only has CLI mode. The instruction of ZSign is detailed here: https://github.com/zhlynn/zsign

# Installing uYouPlus
_‚úîÔ∏é Now that you have AltStore installed on your iDevice, Let's start installing uYouPlus_
## 1. Configure AltStore:
- AltStore is installed on your phone, but you can't open it right now. To fix that, go to `Settings > General > Profile & Device Management`. There will be a profile with your account name in here. After you trust the profile, AltStore can be opened.
<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

- In AltStore, go to `Settings > Sign in with Apple ID`. Enter the Apple ID that was used to install AltStore. If AltStore says **‚ÄúCould not find AltServer‚Äù**, then check if your phone is connected to Mac/PC.
<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

- Congrats üéâ You've just successfully configured AltStore.  

## 2. Install uYouPlus:
- Get the latest version of uYouPlus from the [Release page](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/releases/latest). I use Safari but you can use whatever you want to download the IPA. Select AltStore from the Share sheet. 
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="70%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157609122-17036f02-8122-4e74-bb14-ad03e186e090.PNG">
</p>

- **Remove App Extensions is not recommened** because it will remove the ability to use *Open in YouTube shortcut* & *Open in YouTube Extension* (https://github.com/CokePokes/YoutubeExtensions). uYouPlus will take 3 app IDs in total.  

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="90%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157610652-62f09dc6-18cd-4795-9895-1b1206cf5b7c.PNG">
</p>

- The process might take a few minutes. After that, you will uYouPlus on your Home Screen üéâüéâüéâ

### ‚òû Other methods:

- Another method is use the [direct install link](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus#download) on uYouPlus homepage. Simply open the link and let AltStore does its job. 
 
 - If you have access to AltStore beta, you can add my AltStore repo [here](https://qnblackcat.github.io/AltStore/).

# Refresh uYouPlus
- Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days, and uYouPlus is not an exception. At which point it will no longer open (you'll see an error that says "**YouTube is no longer available**"). 
- To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh uYouPlus in the background. In order for AltStore to do that, you must connect your phone with your Mac/PC via cable or Wi-fi. Then click **Refresh All** in **AltStore > My Apps**
- To enable Refresh Apps over Wi-fi. Make sure your phone and your mac/PC are on the same network.
  - **macOS:** Open Finder and enable ‚ÄúShow this iPhone when on WiFi‚Äù for your phone.
  - **Windows:** Open iTunes and enable iTunes Wi-Fi sync for your phone.
