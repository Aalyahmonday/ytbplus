**Q**: How do I install the IPA???

**A**: Use AltStore, Sideloadly, appdb, or whatever you prefer. If you don't know what are these tools, I suggest you learn about **_Sideloading_** on Goolge. 
##

**Q**: Does it require jailbroken?

**A**: Absolutely NOT. The IPA is made for non-jb users.
##

**Q**: I can't sign into my Google account!!!

**A**: Try to delete the regular YouTube app, then re-install uYou+. If it doesn't help, try another sideload tool.
##

**Q**: Why can't I see 2K/4K quality?

**A**: Make sure you enable **YTUHD** in **YouTube Settings => Video quality preferences**
##

**Q**: Why does it take so long to active PiP? 

**A**: Have you enabled native YouTube PiP in **YouTube Settings => General**? This is where **YouPiP** shines! 
##

**Q**: PiP stop playing when I turn off the screen?

**A**: iOS behave, sorry! Feel free to submit a feedback to Apple.
##

**Q**: What is **Legacy PiP**? Should I enable it?

**A**: No. I wouldn't suggest you enable Legacy PiP. It is a workaround for the speed-up bug that happens on iOS 14.0 - 14.3. I already mentioned about **Legacy PiP** in [Known issues](#known-issues)
##

**Q**: Why can't I disable Background playback?!? I turned off Background playpack in uYou Settings!

**A**: FYI, **YouPiP** enables Background playpack by default. Therefore, you can't completely disable Background playback.

> In case you hate Background playback that much: Extract the IPA, go to `Payload => YouTube.app => Frameworks`, delete **YouPiP.dylib**, and then re-create the IPA. Or you can just make your own version without YouPiP.

**Q**: What is the difference between uYou normal download and uYou Local download?

**A**: MiRO explained it here ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/p5jekg/update_uyou_added_uyoulocal_feature_and_much_more/))
##

**Q**: Slow download speed?

**A**: Well, YouTube slows down the download speed for some reasons. Nothing we can do about it.
##

**Q**: uYou download is not working! (Error 200)

**A**: For appdb users: see [Known issues](#known-issues). For other signing services (ex: Esign...): there is no way to fix it, unfortunately.
