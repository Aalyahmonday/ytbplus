### Requirements:

# Install uYouPlus
## 1. Setup AltStore on your iDevice:
- AltStore is now installed on your phone, but you can't open it right now. To fix that, go to `Settings > General > Profile & Device Management`. There will be a profile with your account name in here. After you trust the profile, AltStore can be opened.
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157607556-fcf5e9d8-9187-4db9-a9da-3acd50f1ab9f.PNG">
</p>

- In AltStore, go to `Settings > Sign in with Apple ID`. Enter the Apple ID that was used to install AltStore. If AltStore says **“Could not find AltServer”**, then check if your phone is connected to Mac/PC.
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="60%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157608485-f72a2cc0-e42f-46bf-9c7b-c41ceeb5dd85.PNG">
</p>

- Congrats 🎉 You've just successfully configured AltStore.  

## 2. Install uYouPlus:
- Get the latest version of uYouPlus from the [Release page](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/releases/latest). I use Safari but you can use whatever you want to download the IPA. Select AltStore from the Share sheet. 
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="70%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157609122-17036f02-8122-4e74-bb14-ad03e186e090.PNG">
</p>

- I recommend you select **Remove App Extensions** when AltStore asks you. Don't worry, it doesn't affect the app's functions. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="90%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157610652-62f09dc6-18cd-4795-9895-1b1206cf5b7c.PNG">
</p>

- The process might take a few minutes. After that, you will uYouPlus on your Home Screen 🎉🎉🎉
***
> - Another method is use the [direct install link](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus#download) on uYouPlus homepage. Simply open the link and let AltStore does its job. 
> 
> - If you have access to AltStore beta, you can add my AltStore repo [here](https://qnblackcat.github.io/AltStore/)

# Refresh uYouPlus
- Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days, and uYouPlus is not an exception. At which point it will no longer open (you'll see an error that says "**YouTube is no longer available**"). 
- To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh uYouPlus in the background. In order for AltStore to do that, you must connect your phone with your Mac/PC via cable or Wi-fi. Then click **Refresh All** in **AltStore > My Apps**
- To enable Refresh Apps over Wi-fi. Make sure your phone and your mac/PC are on the same network.
  - **macOS:** Open Finder and enable “Show this iPhone when on WiFi” for your phone.
  - **Windows:** Open iTunes and enable iTunes Wi-Fi sync for your phone.
