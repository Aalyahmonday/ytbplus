# Install uYouPlus
## 1. Setup AltStore on your iDevice:
- AltStore is now installed to your phone, but you can't open it right now. To fix that, go to `Settings > General > Profile & Device Management`. There will be a profile with your account name in here. After you trust the profile, AltStore can be opened.
<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/157607556-fcf5e9d8-9187-4db9-a9da-3acd50f1ab9f.PNG">
</p>

- In AltStore, go to `Settings > Sign in with Apple ID`. Enter the Apple ID that was used to install AltStore. If AltStore says **‚ÄúCould not find AltServer‚Äù**, then check if your phone is connected to the mac.

</p>

- Congrats. You've just successfully installed AltStore.  

## 2. Install uYouPlus:
- Get the latest version of uYouPlus from https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/releases. I use Safari but you can use whatever you want to download the IPA. Select AltStore from the Share sheet.

</p>

- I recommend you select **Remove App Extensions** when AltStore asks you. Don't worry, it doesn't affect the app's functions.

> - If you have access to AltStore beta, you can my repo from here: `https://qnblackcat.github.io/AltStore/`

# Refresh uYouPlus
- Unfortunately, apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs are only valid for 7 days, and uYouPlus is not an exception. At which point it will no longer open (you'll see an error says "**YouTube is no longer available**"). 
- To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh uYouPlus in the background. In order for AltStore to do that, you must connect your phone with your mac/PC via cable or Wi-fi. Then click **Refresh All** in **AltStore > My Apps**
- To enable Refresh Apps over Wi-fi. Make sure your phone and your mac/PC are on the same network.
  - **macOS:** Open Finder and enable ‚ÄúShow this iPhone when on WiFi‚Äù for your phone.
  - **Windows:** Open iTunes and enable iTunes Wi-Fi sync for your phone.
