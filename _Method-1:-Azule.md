## Method 1: azule (simple way)

1. Setup [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule) on your machine (macOS/Linux/iOS).

2. Download all the tweaks you want to inject.

- [iOS Repo Updates](https://www.ios-repo-updates.com/) is a trust-able source. [**cydownload**](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload) and [Windows Repo Tool](https://github.com/SarahH12099/Windows-Repo-Tool) are good alternatives.

- The sideloaded version of iSponsorBlock is here ([Luewii's fork](https://github.com/Luewii/iSponsorBlock)).

3. Don't forget to prepare a **decrypted** YouTube IPA.

4. Run `azule` in any Terminal window and follow the instruction.

5. Select `1. Inject tweaks`, then Drag & drop the **decrypted** YouTube IPA as long as your tweaks into the azule window. Other azule options are optional.

6. Done! Azule will take care of the rest!
